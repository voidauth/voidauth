## What is VoidAuth

VoidAuth is an open-source SSO authentication and user management provider that stands guard in front of your self-hosted applications. The goal of VoidAuth is to be easy-to-use for admins and end-users, supporting nice-to-have features like passkeys, user invitation, self-registration, email support, and more!

Key Features:

- 🌐 OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider
- 🔄 Proxy ForwardAuth
- 👤 User Management
- 📨 User Self-Registration and Invitations
- 🎨 Customizable Branding (Logo, Title, Theme Color, Email Templates)
- 🔑 Passkeys and Passkey-Only Accounts
- 📧 Secure Password Reset with Email Verification
- 🔒 Encryption-At-Rest with Postgres or SQLite Database

### Admin Panel

Administrators can access the Admin Panel in the sidebar menu, where they can manage users, groups, and settings of the VoidAuth instance.

## Quick Start

Getting started with VoidAuth is straightforward, the recommended approach is to add VoidAuth to a `compose.yml` file:

``` yaml
services:
  # ---------------------------------
  # Your reverse-proxy service here:
  # caddy, traefik, nginx, etc.
  # ---------------------------------

  voidauth: 
    image: voidauth/voidauth:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /your/config/directory:/app/config
    environment:
      # Required environment variables
      # More environment variable options can be found 
      #   on the Getting Started page.
      APP_URL: # required
      STORAGE_KEY: # required
      DB_PASSWORD: # required, same as voidauth-db POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      DB_HOST: voidauth-db # required
    depends_on:
      - voidauth-db

  voidauth-db:
    image: postgres:18
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # required, same as voidauth DB_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker

volumes:
  db:
```

After creating/updating the compose.yml file and filling in the required environment variables, run `docker compose up -d` and visit your `APP_URL` to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After VoidAuth starts for the first time, find the initial administrator username and password in the logs: `docker compose logs voidauth`

Please see the [Getting Started](https://voidauth.app/#/Getting-Started) page for setup details and configuration options.
