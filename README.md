## What is VoidAuth

VoidAuth is an open-source SSO authentication and user management provider that sits in front of your self-hosted applications. Methods of authentication include OpenID Connect (OIDC) for your apps that support it, and Proxy ForwardAuth (ProxyAuth) for those that don't. The web interface aims to provide a professional and customizable authentication experience.

Key Features:

- üåê OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider
- üîÑ Proxy ForwardAuth Domains
- üë§ User Management
- üì® User Self-Registration and Invitations
- üé® Customizable Branding (Logo, Title, Theme Color, Email Templates)
- üîë Passkeys and Passkey-Only Accounts
- üìß Secure Password Reset with Email Verification
- üîí Encryption-At-Rest

## Admin Panel

Administrators can access the Admin Panel in the sidebar menu, where they can manage users, groups, and settings of the VoidAuth instance.

## Quick Start

Getting started with VoidAuth is straightforward, below is an example of how you could add VoidAuth to a `compose.yml` file:
``` yaml
services:
  # ---------------------------------
  # Your reverse-proxy service here:
  # caddy, traefik, nginx, etc.
  # https:// setup is REQUIRED
  # ---------------------------------

  voidauth: 
    image: voidauth/voidauth:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /your/config/directory:/app/config
    environment:
      # Required environment variables
      APP_URL: # required
      STORAGE_KEY: # required
      DB_PASSWORD: # required
      DB_HOST: voidauth-db # required
    depends_on:
      - voidauth-db

  voidauth-db:
    image: postgres:17
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # required
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
```

After creating/updating the compose.yml file and filling in the required environment variables, run `docker compose up -d` and visit your `APP_URL` to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After VoidAuth starts for the first time, find the initial administrator username and password in the logs: `docker compose logs voidauth`

Please see the [Getting Started](https://voidauth.app/#/Getting-Started) page for setup details and configuration options.
