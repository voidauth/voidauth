## Getting Started

Getting started with VoidAuth is straightforward, with just a few lines of Docker Compose you can have it up and running.
``` yaml
services:
  # ---------------------------------
  # Your reverse-proxy service here:
  # caddy, traefik, nginx, etc.
  # ---------------------------------

  voidauth: 
    image: voidauth/voidauth:latest
    volumes:
      - config:/app/config
    environment:
      # Required environment variables
      APP_URL: # required
      STORAGE_KEY: # required
      DB_PASSWORD: # required
      DB_HOST: voidauth-db # required
    depends_on:
      - voidauth-db

  voidauth-db:
    image: postgres:17
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # required
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  config:
  db:
```

After VoidAuth starts for the first time, find the initial administrator username and password in the logs: `docker compose logs voidauth`
