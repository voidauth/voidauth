# Getting Started

## Initial Setup
VoidAuth currently only supports setup through docker. The container image expects a mounted volume for configuration, and a postgres database connection. There are additional required environment variables listed in the example below, a simple Docker Compose setup using a postgres database:

```yaml

services:
  # ---------------------------------
  # Your reverse-proxy service here:
  # caddy, traefik, nginx, etc.
  # https:// setup is REQUIRED
  # ---------------------------------

  voidauth: 
    image: voidauth/voidauth:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /your/config/directory:/app/config
      # - db:/app/db # volume for SQLite file if using SQLite database
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # may not be needed, depending on reverse-proxy setup
    environment:
      # Required environment variables
      APP_URL: # required
      STORAGE_KEY: # required
      DB_PASSWORD: # required unless using SQLite database
      DB_HOST: voidauth-db # required unless using SQLite database
    depends_on:
      - voidauth-db

  voidauth-db:
    image: postgres:17
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # required
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
```

> [!TIP]
> A bind mount as shown for VoidAuth `/app/config` is recommended to enable logo and email template customization.

> [!WARNING]
> VoidAuth does **NOT** provide https termination itself, but it is absolutely **required**. This means you will need a reverse-proxy with https support in front of VoidAuth, as well as your other services.

> [!WARNING]
> The **APP_URL** environment variable **must** be set to the full external url of the VoidAuth service, ex. `APP_URL: https://auth.example.com` or `APP_URL: https://example.com/auth`.

> [!CAUTION]
> During the first start of the app, the **initial admin username and password** will be shown in the logs. They will never be shown again. You will need to note them down and either change the username and password or create a user for yourself, which you should add to the **auth_admins** group. Afterwards you may delete the **auth_admin** user.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any user in the **auth_admins** group will be an administrator in VoidAuth and have access to the admin pages. Do not give this security group to any user you do not want to have full privileges in VoidAuth! You should make a different group for administrators of protected domains/apps.

## Configuration
### Environment Variables
VoidAuth is configurable primarily by environment variable. The available environment variables and their defaults are listed in the table below:

#### App Settings
| Name | Default | Description | Required | Recommended |
| :------ | :-- | :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| APP_URL | | URL VoidAuth will be served on. Must start with`https://`, subdirectory routing is supported. ex. `https://auth.example.com` or `https://example.com/auth` | ðŸ”´ | |
| DEFAULT_REDIRECT | `${APP_URL}` | The home/landing/app url for your domain. This is where users will be redirected upon accepting an invitation, logout, or clicking the logo when already on the auth home page. | | âœ… |
| SIGNUP | `false` | Whether the app allows new users to self-register themselves without invitation. | | |
| SIGNUP_REQUIRES_APPROVAL | `true` | Whether new users who register themselves require approval by an admin. Setting this to **false** while **SIGNUP** is **true** enables open self-registration; use with caution! | | |
| EMAIL_VERIFICATION | `true` if SMTP_HOST is set, otherwise `false` | If true, users must have an email address and will get a verification email when changing their email address before it can be used. If you are using an email provider, this should be set to true. | | |

#### App Customization
| Name | Default | Description | Required | Recommended |
| :------ | :-- | :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| APP_TITLE | `VoidAuth` | Title that will show on the web interface, use your own brand/app/title. | | âœ… |
| APP_PORT | `3000` | The port that app will listen on. | | |
| APP_COLOR | `#906bc7` | Theme color, rgb format; ex. #xxyyzz | | âœ… |
| CONTACT_EMAIL | | The email address used for 'Contact' links, which are shown on most end-user pages if this is set. | | |

#### DB Settings
When using the `sqlite` database adapter type, no additional database connection variables are required. You will need a mounted volume to hold the generated `db.sqlite` file, as shown (commented out) in the docker compose example above.

| Name | Default | Description | Required | Recommended |
| :------ | :-- | :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| DB_ADAPTER | `postgres` | Allowed values are `postgres` and `sqlite`. | | |
| DB_HOST | | Host address of the database. | ðŸ”´ (unless using SQLite database) | |
| DB_PASSWORD | | Password of the database. If you do not enter one VoidAuth will recommend one to you. | ðŸ”´ (unless using SQLite database) | |
| DB_PORT | `5432` | Port of the database. Not used if using SQLite database. | | |
| DB_USER | `postgres` | Username used to sign into the database by the app. Not used if using SQLite database. | | |
| DB_NAME | `postgres` | Database name used to connect to the database by the app. Not used if using SQLite database. | | |
| STORAGE_KEY | | Storage encryption key for secret values such as keys and client secrets. Must be at least 32 characters long and should be randomly generated. If you do not enter one VoidAuth will recommend one to you. | ðŸ”´ | |
| STORAGE_KEY_SECONDARY | | Secondary storage encryption key, used when rotating the primary storage encryption key. | | |


#### SMTP Settings
All of these settings are âœ… recommended to be set to the correct values for your email provider.

| Name | Default | Description |
| :------ | :-- | :-------- |
| SMTP_HOST | | SMTP Host; ex. `mail.example.com` |
| SMTP_FROM | | SMTP From field; ex.`My App<app@example.com>` |
| SMTP_PORT | `587` | SMTP port to use. |
| SMTP_SECURE | `false` | SMTP has TLS/SSL enabled. |
| SMTP_USER | | SMTP username used to sign into email provider; ex `user@example.com` |
| SMTP_PASS | | SMTP password used to sign into email provider |

#### Misc.
| Name | Default | Description | Required | Recommended |
| :------ | :-- | :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| PASSWORD_STRENGTH | `3` | The minimum strength of users passwords, at least 3 is recommended. Must be between 0 - 4. | | |
| ADMIN_EMAILS | `hourly` | The minimum duration between admin notification emails. Can be set to values like: '4 hours', '30 minutes', 'weekly', 'daily', etc. If set to 'false', admin notification emails are disabled. | | | 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some configuration options only make sense when used together. **EMAIL_VERIFICATION** should only be set if the **SMTP_** options are also set. Likewise, **SIGNUP_REQUIRES_APPROVAL** does nothing unless **SIGNUP** is set.

### Config Directory
Your own branding can be applied to the app by mounting the **/app/config** directory and adding files or modifying the existing files.

The logo and favicon of the web interface can be customized by placing your own **logo.svg**/**logo.png** and **favicon.svg**/**favicon.png** in the mounted **/app/config/branding** directory. You can also add an **apple-touch-icon.png** file to **/app/config/branding**.

The email templates for email verification, invitations, and password resets can be changed by modifying the files in the **/app/config/email_templates** directory. The files are [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template format and text, which should be updated together when changed. To reset your changes to the email templates, just delete (or move) your **/app/config/email_templates** directory and it will be regenerated on app restart.

### Customization
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are enough branding options between environment variables like **APP_TITLE**, **APP_COLOR**, and config directory customization to remove any end-user reference to VoidAuth branding. You can make it your own! Below is an example of some theming changes and light mode enabled:

### Authentication
To start setting up protected applications, there are two options available. If the application supports OIDC integration you can follow the instructions in the [OIDC Setup](OIDC-Setup.md) guide. If the application does not support OIDC or you just want to secure a specific path, you should follow the [ProxyAuth](ProxyAuth-and-Trusted-Header-SSO-Setup.md) guide.

## Experimental
> [!WARNING]
> The following configurations are not well supported or tested, but may cover additional use-cases.
### Multi-Domain Protection
You can secure multiple domains you own by running multiple instances of VoidAuth using the same database. They should have the same **STORAGE_KEY** and **DB_\*** variables, but may otherwise have completely different configurations. The **APP_URL** variables of each would cover a different domain. If the domains you were trying to secure were `example.com` and `your-domain.net` you might set the **APP_URL** variables like `https://auth.example.com` and `https://id.your-domain.net`. These two instances would share everything in the shared DB, including users, OIDC clients, ProxyAuth Domains, etc.
