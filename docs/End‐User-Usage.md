# Usage

## Login
Users are directed to the login portal if they are not already signed into VoidAuth and they either visit the **APP_URL** directly or are redirected there through the **OIDC Client** or **Proxy Auth** flows. VoidAuth supports password login, as well as passkey login (Face ID, Windows Hello, etc). There is also a "Forgot Password" option, which will redirect to the [Forgot Password](#forgot-password) page. The "Remember Me" checkbox will attempt to make the user session last through device restarts for up to one year, as long as the user signs in with their password instead of any other method.

## Sign Up
If the **SIGNUP** environment variable is set, there will be an option on the [Login](#login) page to Sign Up. A username is required, and so is an email if the **EMAIL_VERIFICATION** environment variable is set. Password strength requirements are set by the **PASSWORD_STRENGTH** environment variable. The current password strength is calculated with [zxcvbn-ts](https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/).

The passkey options will only show if a user's session was not started with a passkey and they have not created a passkey with the current session. When a user login directly to VoidAuth is complete with a method other than a passkey, it will attempt to automatically add a passkey.
