# Password Resets

Password Reset requests are managed from the admin Password Resets page. From there you can create a new Password Reset request for a user by searching in the top bar. You can also see existing Password Reset requests. For each, you can Copy the reset link, Send the Password Reset email to the user, or delete the request.

> [!NOTE]
> Users should be able to request their own Password Resets from the Login page, but may need an admin to send them the reset link if their email address is not set or the email did not send.
