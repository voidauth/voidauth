# Contributing to VoidAuth

Contributions to VoidAuth are welcome! Lets get started.

## Support

Issues, Suggestions, and Feature Requests should be added as [Issues](https://github.com/voidauth/voidauth/issues) of the appropriate type. For Help and Support, Q&A, or anything else; open a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/voidauth/discussions).

## Documentation Updates

Documentation updates should made in the docs/ directory and a PR opened for approval of the changes.

## Development Environment

VoidAuth consists of a Frontend `./frontend` and Backend `./server`. The frontend is served through the backend, and when developing the frontend is automatically rebuilt when changes are detected. To see those frontend changes on the web UI the page must be refreshed. Lets get set up!

### Prerequisites

- An IDE supporting Javascript/Typescript development, such as VSCode
- Node.js >= 22.17.0 installed on your development machine
- Docker Compose, or different way to run your own local Postgres DB

### Starting the Project

All paths and actions are in the project root directory unless otherwise specified.

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install backend dependencies.
2. In the `./frontend` directory, run `npm install` in your terminal to install frontend dependencies.
3. Configure a `.env` file  use the `.example.env` file as a template. All variables in `.example.env` are required in `.env`, though you can add additional variables as well.
4. Run `docker compose up -d voidauth-db` or equivalent in your terminal to start the VoidAuth database locally.
5. Run `npm start` to build and start the project.
6. Visit `localhost:3000` or your configured `APP_URL` to view the VoidAuth web UI.

## Contribution Standards

All code contributions are expected to be thoroughly tested and defect-free. Changes must also pass Typescript checking and linting, which are checked automatically for every PR. You can manually run Typescript and linting locally by running `npx tsc && npx eslint ./`, they should run automatically when committing code.

Pull Requests (PRs) should follow the template that appears when they are opened. Make sure to list every feature and fix contained in the PR, screenshots should be attached if any changes to the frontend UI were made.
